# stock-analysis

## Purpose

The original workbook that we created for Steve works well with a small sample size of stocks. While it could work on a data set with thousands of stock it could take a long time to execute. In this challenge we will refactor the Module 2 solution to loop through all the data at once. With the findings we can determine if refactoring the data made it excute quicker.
